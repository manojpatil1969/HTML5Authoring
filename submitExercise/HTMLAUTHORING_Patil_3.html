            <p>
                The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger will combine forces
                to create an open-source, standards-based cross-platform project to
                bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. "At Hyperledger, we're 
                very focused at building communities that build a set of software
                products and many of those touch on and implement Ethereum related
                standards, and the EEA is focused on driving a community of organizations 
                around a common set of standards and then certifying applications against
                those standards," says EEA Executive Director Ron Resnick.
