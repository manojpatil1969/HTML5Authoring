                            The Airbus 220, previously known as Bombardier CSeries or (C Series), is a 
                            family of narrow-body. twin-engine, medium-range, jet airlines marketed by
                            Airbus but designed and originally built by the Canadian Manufacturer Bombardier
                            Aero space. Following Airbus involvement the aircraft are built by CSeries Aircraft 
                            Limited Partnership (CSALP).

                            A jet airliner or jetliner is an airliner powered by jet engines (passenger jet aircraft)
                            Airliners usually have two or four jet engines, three-engined designs were popular in the 
                            1970s, but are less common today. Airliners are commonly classified as either the large 
                            wide-body aircraft, medium narrow-body aircraft and smaller regional jet.

                            The 1930s saw a number of important technological developments for flying.
                            One of the most important developments was the switch to metal-bodies airplanes
                            instead of the old standrad-wood. Metal Planes could fly further and were more 
                            confirtable because the interior was actually climate-controlled. Military 
                            aircraft in particularbecame faster and performed better, which was important as 
                            World War-II was just around the corner.
